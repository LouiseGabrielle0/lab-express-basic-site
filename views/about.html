          <h1>Younger Life</h1>
          <p>
            Rick grew up in Georgia, somewhere near Atlanta. As a child, he
            shared a close relationship with his father whom he described as a
            'profound' man who instilled a strong moral code onto him. His
            mother often told him the story of; The Stone in The Road, which
            encouraged him to never give up in the face of adversity. He also
            became inspired by the old tales of his grandfather, whom served
            during the Second World War. After being injured in a shootout, Rick
            slips into a coma for a month. He wakes up to find the hospital
            deserted and abandoned, a zombie apocalypse in full swing. We hate
            when that happens. What follows is Rick's quest to find his wife and
            son and protect them. Because Rick has no idea what happened to the
            world during his coma, we discover the extent of the zombie outbreak
            right along with him. Of course, unlike the protagonists of most
            zombie stories, we've actually read a zombie novel and seen a zombie
            movie or two. Rick seems consistently shocked that things are as bad
            as they are, and he's always talking about "when things get back to
            normal" (121). (Seriously, has no one read World War Z here?!)
            Rick's single-minded motivation is to find his family: his wife,
            Lori, and his son, Carl. He flees from the zombies in the hospital
            and heads to his home, also destroyed and deserted except for a man
            and his son squatting on the property. The man clues him in to the
            horror of the situation and points him toward Atlanta, where people
            were encouraged to flee. Rick fights off a horde of the undead in
            Atlanta, and runs like heck before he makes it to a survivor camp
            where he finds Lori and Carl. From then on, Rick's priority is
            keeping them safe. This sets up the conflict for the second half of
            chapter one.

            When The Going Gets Tough, The Tough Start Bickering Also at the
            camp is Shane, Rick's police partner. Shane did what Rick couldn't:
            he got Lori and Carl to safety. Also, he slept with Lori, although
            neither of them share that with Rick. Tension rises when Rick
            suggests to Shane that they move camp. For some reason, Rick has
            dropped his "when things get back to normal" attitude and is
            planning for the long-term, whereas Shane still remains optimistic
            that things are going to get better. Shane doesn't want to move
            camp. Rick does. The men bicker like high school lab partners trying
            to decide on a science project. Rick decides to accumulate an
            arsenal of guns and teach everyone to shoot guns at camp, including
            his seven-year-old. The plan works, but it isn't foolproof. Zombies
            attack. Amy, one of the survivors, is chomped to bits, and Rick
            blames Shane for not moving camp, yelling at him, "How many more
            people have to die before you realize that?!" (678). Even though
            Rick's angry, he tries to keep their conflict private, preferring to
            talk to Shane in the woods. But Shane freaks out and punches Rick in
            camp, destroying what little remains of their idyllic survivor
            lifestyle. Somehow, through all this, Rick still remains optimistic,
            thinking he can talk sense into Shane. He can't. Like all zombie
            stories, the conflict boils down to man vs. man (instead of man vs.
            un-man), and Rick's gun-toting seven-year-old shoots Shane when
            Shane pulls a gun on Rick. Rick is left to comfort his son, who's
            entered into the cruel adult world all too soon. That might be a
            dad's worst nightmare, even worse than zombies.
